# Pizza-Shop-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Project-on-SQL-and-Excel

ðŸ“Š Overview
This is my first project using SQL for data analysis and Excel for dashboard creation.
I analyzed a pizza shop's sales data to uncover business insights, calculated key performance indicators (KPIs), and designed a data-driven dashboard to help pizza shop owners make informed decisions.
ðŸš€ Key Achievements
Cleaned and analyzed raw sales data using SQL.
Calculated key KPIs such as:
Total revenue
Average order value
Top-selling pizzas
Sales trends by day and hour
Designed a dynamic, visual dashboard using pivot tables, pivot charts, and Excel features.
Delivered insights aimed at helping pizza shop owners optimize operations and increase sales.
âš¡ Challenges and Learnings
Issue Faced:
While creating the dashboard, I built several pivot tables. Some were created with the "Add this data to the Data Model" option enabled, while others were not.
As a result, a single Timeline filter could not be applied across all pivot tables.
Workaround:
I had to insert two separate Timeline filters to accommodate the different pivot tables.
Key Learning:
Always maintain consistency when creating pivot tables, especially when planning to use global slicers or timelines across the dashboard.
ðŸ”® Next Steps
Always add data to the model when creating pivot tables for unified control.
Explore Power Pivot and Power Query for handling larger datasets and building scalable data models.
Continue improving my skills in dashboard design, storytelling with data, and advanced Excel techniques.
Start exploring Power BI for even more dynamic dashboards in future projects.
